## Getting Started

To use or contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-quiz.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Quiz Structure

The quiz is organized within the HTML document, consisting of a set of questions, options, and a submit button. Each question is presented with multiple-choice options, and users can select one option for each question.

```html
<!-- Example of a quiz question structure -->
<div class="question">
    <p>1. What does HTML stand for?</p>
    <div class="option">
        <input type="radio" name="q1" value="A">
        <label for="">A. Hyper Text Markup Language</label>
    </div>
    <!-- ... (other options) -->
</div>
```

## Styling

The styling is done using CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. Colors, fonts, and layout have been carefully designed to enhance the overall quiz experience.

```css
/* Example CSS styling for the quiz */
.quiz {
    background-color: rgba(223, 214, 214, 0.993);
    padding: 30px;
}

/* ... (other styling rules) */
```

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the quiz logic. It checks user answers against the correct answers, calculates the score, and provides feedback by applying appropriate styling to each question.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript functionality for the quiz
const correctAnswers = ['A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'D', 'C'];

// ... (other JavaScript code)
```
